## 7 Data integrity and authenticity

### R7 The repository guarantees the integrity and authenticity of the data.

# Data integrity 
<a name="integrity"></a>

Upon ingest the checksums are calculated by [FITS](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/fits) and stored alongside the metadata:

![checksum](./assets/checksum.png)

These checksums are weekly checked against the actual resources on disk. Here is an example report for collection 1007 (with some engineered errors):

![checksum](./assets/1007-check.png)

FITS also determines basic properties, which can be used to determine if a resource meets the institutes criteria, e.g. the actual codec used by video or audo files.

The completeness of the metadata is validated by a CMDI profile, i.e., on the collection level that is [the Meertens Collection profile](https://menzowindhouwer.github.io/lab/cr2html/#clarin.eu:cr1:p_1440426460262) and on deeper levels more collection specific profiles can be used, e.g., [a Roots of Etnolect conversation](https://menzowindhouwer.github.io/lab/cr2html/#clarin.eu:cr1:p_1454489235460). A CMDI profile defines which metadata elements are available and which of these are mandatory. Such a profiles is translated into an XML schema, which is used for the basic validation of the metadata. Next to this a Schematron validation with institute specific rules is run. If one of these results in an error the deposit is cancelled. Warnings are, however, passed on to the collection manager, who will resolve them with or without the depositor.

# Data authenticity 
<a name="authenticity"></a>

All changes to a dataset are logged in the audit trail, which is default functionality of the Fedora repository system.

The repository system also offers versioning support for both metadata and data. Where older versions remain available via their handles. Another option is to put versions explicitly next to each other, distinguished by versioning information, e.g., a year, in the title.  Which version strategy is applied to an update of a dataset is determined by the collection manager together with the depositor. Resources belonging to the new versions undergoe the same checks as new deposits, i.e., using FITS to check there type and basic properties, e.g., sample rate for audio files.

Checks if a curation transformation doesn't loose any data is part of the curation process, e.g. for multipage tiffs which are turned into images of single pages the total count of pages is checked.

The server running the repository interface is a member of the CLARIN Server Provider Federation: [https://github.com/clarin-eric/SPF-SPs-metadata/blob/master/metadata/www.meertens.knaw.nl%252FShibboleth.sso%252FMetadata.xml](https://github.com/clarin-eric/SPF-SPs-metadata/blob/master/metadata/www.meertens.knaw.nl%252FShibboleth.sso%252FMetadata.xml) Depositors thus login using their credentials from their home institute. Using this mechanism the identities of the depositors are guaranteed by their home institutions. Here is an example of the login flow:

-1- login link at the repository frontend:

![checksum](./assets/login-1.png)

-2- Where are you from:

![checksum](./assets/login-2.png)

-3- authentication at the home institution:

![checksum](./assets/login-3.png)

-4- user profile at the repository:

![checksum](./assets/login-4.png)
