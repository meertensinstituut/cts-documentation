For this Requirement, responses on data integrity should include evidence related to the following:
● Description of checks to verify that a digital object has not been altered or corrupted (i.e.,
fixity checks) from deposit to use.


● Documentation of the completeness of the data and metadata.
● Details of how all changes to the data and metadata are logged.
● Description of version control strategy.
● Usage of appropriate international standards and conventions (which should be specified).

Evidence of authenticity management should relate to the following questions:
● Does the repository have a strategy for data changes? Are data producers made aware of
this strategy?
● Does the repository maintain provenance data and related audit trails?
● Does the repository maintain links to metadata and to other datasets? If so, how?
● Does the repository compare the essential properties of different versions of the same file?
How?
● Does the repository check the identities of depositors?
