## R7 Data integrity and authenticity

# Data integrity 
<a name="integrity"></a>

Upon ingest the checksums are calculated by [FITS](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/fits) and stored alongside the metadata:

![checksum](./assets/checksum.png)

These checksums are regularely checked against the actual resources on disk

![checksum](./assets/1007-check.png)
(with some engineered errors)

Metadata is validated by a CMDI profile, i.e., on the collection level that is [the Meertens Collection profile](https://menzowindhouwer.github.io/lab/cr2html/#clarin.eu:cr1:p_1440426460262) and on deeper levels more collection specific profiles can be used, e.g., [a Roots of Etnolect conversation](https://menzowindhouwer.github.io/lab/cr2html/#clarin.eu:cr1:p_1454489235460). Next to this basic XSD validation also a Schematron validation is run. If one of these results in an error submission is impossible. Warnings are passed on to the collection manager, who will resolve them with or without the depositor.

All changes to a dataset are logged in the audit trail offered as the default functionaility of the Fedora repository system.

[ ] TODO: show AUDIT snippet


● Description of version control strategy.
● Usage of appropriate international standards and conventions (which should be specified).

Evidence of authenticity management should relate to the following questions:
● Does the repository have a strategy for data changes? Are data producers made aware of
this strategy?
● Does the repository maintain provenance data and related audit trails?
● Does the repository maintain links to metadata and to other datasets? If so, how?
● Does the repository compare the essential properties of different versions of the same file?
How?
● Does the repository check the identities of depositors?
